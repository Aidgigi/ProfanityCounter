# ProfanityCounter
The source code and information related to u/profanitycounter


### What is u/profanitycounter?
u/profanitycounter is a reddit bot that's purpose is to create public profanity reports, in the form of a comment. Simply tag the
bot under a user's comment, and u/profanitycounter will check and report back the profanity usage of this individual. Reports take
anywhere from a couple of seconds to a couple of minutes. It really depends on system load.


### What can I do with this code?
Well, it's up to you really. Use this code to build a bot of your own, take inspiration and develop something cool, or anything
else under the sun. All I ask is that you don't just blatantly copy and use this code with a different bot account. This code
isn't even everything you need to run the bot so I'm not really worried. Basically, don't be an a\**hole.


### What can I do if I want to help?
I'm always open to help, feedback, and people willing to make the bot better in any way. Just shoot my [reddit account]
(https://reddit.com/u/Aidgigi) a DM and I'll get back within 24 hours. Please also state what you want to improve or what you
wish to add to the code. Like I said, I'll probably let you help out, unless you just don't know how to code heh.
